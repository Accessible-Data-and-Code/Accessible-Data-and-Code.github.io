## Scope of Content

Are you a computational scientist, [research software engineer](https://us-rse.org/about/what-is-an-rse/) (RSEs), [academic data scientist](https://academicdatascience.org/community-projects/career-guidebook/), computational scientist, domain scientist, social scientist, digital humanities researcher, student, or someone who use Jupyter Notebooks in a research setting? 

We enthusiastically welcome your contributions to the Jupyter4.science site about **developing and sharing Jupyter Notebooks** **in the context of scientific applications**. We also welcome articles about **FAIR Principles**, **reproducibility**, **open science**, **accessibility** (usable by people with disabilities), and other matters of **inclusivity** as they relate to computational notebooks. 

Looking for more ideas? Check out out [Zotero Collection](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5403897/jupyter4science/collections/B7HER82C) for curated content that hasn't made it on the site yet.

## Types of Content

**Blog post**: An article with original content in the range of around 500-1500 words. We are in the process of developing templates with suggested outlines, but other formats are welcome.

- **experience reports** that describe the trials and successes you have had using Jupyter widgets, JupyterLab extensions, or any other Jupyter-based tools you have used to develop or share your research.
- **news articles** that report on new tools or new features of existing tools

**Curated content:** Brief article that highlights other web-based content (such as tools, websites, books, organizations, YouTube videos, podcast episodes, publications, etc.). Your article should describe why the content is valuable for the Jupyter4Science audience. 

- **Publications**
- **Books**
- **Websites**
- **Software/Tools**
- **Videos**
- **Talks/Events**

### Out-of-scope content

- Content that does not fit the scope of the website as defined on the [About Page]({{< ref "/about" >}})
- Content that speaks disparagingly about or implies the inferiority of user-friendly tools (for example, that JupyterLab development environment "better than" the traditional Jupyter Notebook interface in all cases)
- The site administrator reserves the right to reject content that incomplete, noninclusive, or for any other reason
