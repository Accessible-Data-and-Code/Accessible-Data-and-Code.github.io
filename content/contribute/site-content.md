## Scope of Content

Are you a computational scientist, [research software engineer](https://us-rse.org/about/what-is-an-rse/) (RSEs), [academic data scientist](https://academicdatascience.org/community-projects/career-guidebook/) computational scientist, domain scientist, social scientist, digital humanities researcher, student, or someone who use Jupyter Notebooks in a research setting? 

We enthusiastically welcome your contributions to the Jupyter4.science site about **developing and sharing Jupyter Notebooks** **in the context of scientific applications**. We also welcome articles about **FAIR Principles**, **reproducibility**, **open science**, **accessibility** (usable by people with disabilities), and other matters of **inclusivity** as they relate to computational notebooks. 

Looking for more ideas? Check out out [Zotero Collection]() for curated content that hasn't made it on the site yet.

## Types of Content

### Types of Content
We solicit the following types of content from our readers and the community.

**Blog post**: An article with original content in the range of around 500-1500 words. 

- We are particularly interested in **experience reports** in which you describe the trials, errors, and successes you have had using Jupyter widgets, JupyterLab extensions, or any other Jupyter-based tools you have used to develop or share your research. Other possibilities are **news articles** that report on new tools

**Curated content:** Brief article that highlights other web-based content (such as tools, websites, books, organizations, YouTube videos, podcast episodes, publications, etc.). Your article should describe why the content is valuable for the Jupyter4Science audience. 

- **Publications**
- **Books**
- **Websites**
- **Software/Tools**
- **Videos**

**Event:** Brief description of an event (such as a workshop, conference, or tutorial) relevant to better scientific software.



- **Pages**: any general content
- **Landing Pages**: pages that can consist of content _blocks_, such as the **homepage**
- **Posts**: blog posts or news
- **Publications**: import your research publications from BibTeX
- **Talks/Events**: publish any talks which you are presenting
- **Slides**: write slides very efficiently with Markdown, present them at your talk, and share them online

### Out-of-scope content

- Content that does not fit the scope of the website as defined on the [About page]() 
- Content that speaks disparagingly about or implies the inferiority of user-friendly tools (for example, that JupyterLab development environment "better than" the traditional Jupyter Notebook interface in all cases)
- Pieces that present opinion as if it were fact or opinions that are based solely on moral judgment rather than reasoning, and are not qualified as such
- The site administrator reserves the right to reject content that is incomplete, noninclusive, or for any other reason
## Still have questions?

- If you have questions about contributing content that does not fit the above pre-defined types, please contact us using the [Questions about contributions](https://bssw.io/pages/questions-about-contributing-to-better-scientific-software) page.
