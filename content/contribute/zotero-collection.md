## What is a Zotero Group Collection?

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, cite, and share research. A **Collection** is a specific feature within Zotero that allows users to organize their references into folders. [**Groups**](https://www.zotero.org/support/groups) provide a powerful way to collaborative curate and share collections.
