  abstract = {Jupyter notebooks have become a widely used standard for sharing modest data workflows. In this month's community call, we will talk about how people extend notebooks beyond the standard uses. What creative ways have you come up with to get most of your notebooks? How far can you go before needing a different technology stack? Join us to share your experiences! Nicole Brewer will kick things off with a quick introduction to using notebooks to deploy standalone web applications. She will discuss how she uses JupyterLab + nbdev to approximate an IDE and hidden advantages that manifest when developing widget-based apps in that environment. Learn about how this approach makes the codebase more modular, reusable, readable, and inheritable by the research labs that use them.},

  abstract = {Scientists are increasingly interested in creating standalone web-applications as computational and data analysis tools. The authors have worked with several such research groups to design, develop, and deploy such web applications that are increasingly based on Jupyter notebooks. One of the primary reasons among many to use Jupyter notebooks is the fact that research groups inheriting these applications are capable of maintaining and extending them. In this paper, we walk through the design process for one such application and discuss development environments that are best suited to Jupyter notebook development. We then explore several other applications where we employ similar design patterns. In doing so, we expound upon the benefits, limitations, and challenges of Notebook-based applications to provide a guide for other facilitators in similar situations.},

  abstract = {Researchers are increasingly interested in using Jupyter Notebooks on HPC clusters, science gateways, and compostable platforms. In addition to using notebooks for scientific workflows, developers can use interactive browser controls, called widgets, to allow users to more easily interact with data and without editing code. In addition to simple widgets, such as sliders, checkboxes, and text inputs, more advanced features can be used to build standalone data dashboards and web applications. Many of these widgets and data visualizations are domain independent, though users may discover them in an ad hoc fashion, which can cause an onslaught of tickets to request particular libraries. To avoid frustration faced by users and system administrators alike, we present a recommended environment for scientists and research software engineers developing Jupyter Notebook on cyberinfrastructure platforms.},
