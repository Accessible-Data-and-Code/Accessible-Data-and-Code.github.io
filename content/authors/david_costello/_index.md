### Hi, my name is David (Costello) üëã

I am a senior at ASU studying mathematics doing research in Greek manuscript transcription. The hope is to create a way of automatically transcribing handwritten Greek texts for analysis in the Digital Humanities.

I come from Grand Junction, CO, ‚õ∞Ô∏èüèúÔ∏è so I have a significant interest in pursuing research for agriculture, urban development, and water rights/use in the future as a way to give back to a community that has given me so much.

I started my college years pursuing a degree in biophysics, but I found the mathematics and the philosophy of science and logic more interesting.

Fun fact - My GitHub username (Dcosthephalump) comes from my oldest sibling and I have used it for over a decade now.

Outside of mathematics (in a loose order):

üìù I am applying for a PhD at ASU (looking at Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Complex Adaptive Systems Science)

üìú I am studying Greek and Hebrew to read manuscripts

‚úèÔ∏è I am writing (slowly) a manual on debate
