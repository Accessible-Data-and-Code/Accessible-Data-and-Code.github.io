David Costello is an undergraduate senior in mathematics at Arizona State University's Barrett Honors College. When David joined the Jupyter4Science team as a full time intern for the summer of 2023, he had a keen interest in the digital humanities and a computational notebook containing a research workflow for performing image processing steps on Greek manuscripts. David was hired to transition his Jupyter-based workflow into a full-fledged web application. By the end of the summer, David had developed a notebook-based manuscript annotation tool called [Glyptodon](https://github.com/Jupyter4Science/glyptodon), which was also a major feature of David's undergraduate honors thesis.
