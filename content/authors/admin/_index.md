Nicole is a research software engineer and PhD student in History and Philosophy of Science at ASU where she is studying the reproducibility of Jupyter Notebooks used in research. She holds a B.S. in Mathematics with Computer Science from Purdue University, where she used high-performance computing to conduct research in combinatorial game theory. After graduation, she stayed at Purdue as a staff software engineer as part of the [Scientific Solutions Group](https://communityhub.purdue.edu/groups/ssg/overview) in Research Computing. There, she contributed internally to the science gateway MyGeoHub and spent time embedded in with a research lab on campus. She has served as co-chair for [Women in HPC at Purdue University](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/whpc), host of the [Long Tales of Science podcast](https://www.nicole-brewer.com/long-tales-of-science/), member of the steering committee for the [United States Research Software Engineering Association](https://us-rse.org/about/steering-committee/), council member for the [International Council of RSE Association](https://researchsoftware.org/council.html), and most recently, co-chair of the [Notebooks Subcommittee for the US-RSE conference](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/participate/notebooks/) in 2023 and 2024. Nicole is the editor of the Jupyter4Science site, which was made possible by her receipt of the [Better Scientific Software Fellowship](https://bssw.io/fellows/nicole-brewer) in 2023.
