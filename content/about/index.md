        ## **Introduction**
          *Welcome to Jupyter4Science!*
          
          At Jupyter4Science, we're dedicated to empowering researchers, research software engineers (RSEs), and students alike with the necessary skills to succeed in the field of scientific software development. Led by BSSw Fellow Nicole Brewer, our initiative is working on making scientific software accessible and reproducible for the universal growth of the field through the use of Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter makes an excellent platform for development because it can be easily understood, inherited, and maintained by researchers, especially in an interdisciplinary environment. Our resources, including tutorials, example notebooks, and curated content, provide users with practical insights and better practices for sharing reproducible workflows and developing high-quality software, all within the Jupyter ecosystem.
