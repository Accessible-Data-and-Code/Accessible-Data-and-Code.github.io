        ## **Introduction**
          *Welcome to Jupyter4Science!*
          
        Jupyter4Science is a **knowledge base** that contains original content and curated resources about developing and sharing Jupyter Notebooks as they are used in the context of scientific applications.

        Computational notebooks, including Jupyter Notebooks, come in many varieties, but they all have one thing in common: much like traditional laboratory notebooks, computational notebooks contain code cells interspersed with text that can be used to explain their analysis. <div style="margin: auto;">![screen reader text](image1.png "This is an example of Markdown formatted text followed by code chunks")</div>

        However, our knowledge base is intended for a **research-oriented audience**, including computational scientists, [research software engineers](https://us-rse.org/about/what-is-an-rse/) (RSEs), [academic data scientists](https://academicdatascience.org/community-projects/career-guidebook/), social scientists, digital humanities researchers, and students, and anyone else who use Jupyter Notebooks to conduct research. Our aim is to provide rich resources for researchers, students, and RCD professionals about **better practices** to improve the **accessibility**, **reuse**, and **reproducibility** of their scientific software, data, and computational workflows.

        The knowledge base contains original content including tutorials, templates, blog posts, and example notebooks. We also curate and summarize external content like YouTube videos, podcast episodes, and more.
        - Development Environments for Jupyter Notebooks
        - Reproducible Environments
        - Sharing Notebooks
        - Creating Publications with Quarto
        - Templates and Best Practices
        - Jupyter Notebooks as Peer-Reviewed Publications
        - Building Data Dashboards and Web Applications with Jupyter Notebooks
        - and an overview from a [10,000 foot view]()
        
        We hope that these resources reduce pain points and improve the efficiency and quality of your research. We're excited to introduce Jupyter4Science to you!
